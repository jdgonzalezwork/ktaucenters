Description:This package implements a kind of kmeans algorithm, it has two main advantages:(a) The estimator is resistant to outliers, that means that results of estimator are still correct when there are atipycal values in the sample and (b) The estimator is efficient, roughly speaking, if there are not outliers in the sample (all data is good), results will be similar than those obtained by a classic algorithm (kmeans). Clustering procedure is carried out by minimizing the overall robust scale so-called tau scale.
